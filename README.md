# House Tax Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict the house tax for properties in Boston, Massachusetts, using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for training and testing the models contains information about different features related to the properties in Boston, such as crime rate, zoning proportions, proximity to Charles River, nitric oxides concentration, number of rooms, age of houses, accessibility to highways, and more.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately predicting the house tax based on the given set of features. The dataset contains historical data, and the model will be trained to learn the relationships between the input features and the house tax (target variable). The model's performance will be evaluated using different machine learning algorithms to identify the most accurate predictor.

## Dataset Information

The dataset used for this project is derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the Boston, Massachusetts area. It comprises 506 rows and 14 columns. Each row represents a Boston town or suburb, and each column represents a specific feature related to the properties in that area. The target variable, "TAX," indicates the full-value property-tax rate per $10,000, which is what we aim to predict using the other features.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used

Three different machine learning algorithms were employed in this project:

1. **Random Forests**: A popular and versatile machine learning algorithm that combines the outputs of multiple decision trees to reach a final prediction. Random forests handle both classification and regression tasks effectively and provide accurate results.

2. **Multiple Regression**: Multiple linear regression is a statistical technique used to model complex relationships between multiple independent variables and one dependent variable. It helps identify the most significant factors that influence the target variable.

3. **Decision Trees**: A supervised machine learning algorithm used for categorization and making predictions based on a series of questions. Decision trees are a form of supervised learning, trained and tested on labeled data, and are effective for regression tasks as well.

## Conclusion

After implementing and evaluating the three machine learning algorithms, we found that the Random Forest algorithm provided the highest accuracy in predicting house tax, followed by Decision Trees and Multiple Regression. The project demonstrates the importance of using machine learning for predicting house tax accurately, enabling better decision-making for property owners and real estate professionals.
